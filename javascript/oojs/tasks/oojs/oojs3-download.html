    /* Finally, we'd like you to start with the ES `Shape` class you created in the last task.

We'd like you to create a `Square` class that inherits from `Shape`, and adds a `calcArea()` method that calculates the square's area. Also set up the constructor so that the `name` property of `Square` object instances is automatically set to `square`, and the `sides` property is automatically set to `4`. When invoking the constructor, you should therefore just need to provide the `sideLength` property.

Create an instance of the `Square` class called `square` with appropriate property values, and call its `calcPerimeter()` and `calcArea()` methods to show that it works OK. */

    class Shape {
      constructor(name, sides, sideLength) {
        this.name = name;
        this.sides = sides;
        this.sideLength = sideLength;
      }
      calcPerimeter() {
        console.log(`its perimeter is ${this.sides * this.sideLength}`);
      }
    }
    class Square extends Shape {
      constructor(sideLength) {
        super("square", 4, sideLength);
      }

      calcArea() {
        console.log(`its area is ${this.sideLength * this.sideLength}`);
      }
    }
    const square = new Square(5);
    square.calcArea();
    square.calcPerimeter();
