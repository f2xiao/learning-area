     In our first strings task, we start off small. You already have half of a famous quote inside a variable called `quoteStart`; we would like you to:

1.  Look up the other half of the quote, and add it to the example inside a variable called `quoteEnd`.
2.  Concatenate the two strings together to make a single string containing the complete quote. Save the result inside a variable called `finalQuote`.

You'll find that you get an error at this point. Can you fix the problem with `quoteStart`, so that the full quote displays correctly?*/
    // Add your code here

    let quoteStart = 'Don\'t judge each day by the harvest you reap ';
    let quoteEnd = 'but by the Seeds that you Plant. ';
    let finalQuote = quoteStart + quoteEnd;

    // Don't edit the code below here!

    const section = document.querySelector('section');
    let para1 = document.createElement('p');
    para1.textContent = finalQuote;
